# Hello Guys <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="35px">, I am cyberpands

I'm now completing a master's degree in cybersecurity, which has led me to learn that breaking into computers requires numerous manual procedures. As a result, while not everything can be automated, I decided to automate the fundamental startup process using the coding skills I now possess. But, the goal of creating Github repositories is to automate the manual activities of everyday living.
